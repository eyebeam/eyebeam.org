Some basic ground rules:
- I don't conform to WordPress style guide, because it looks gross to my eyes.
- I use tabs for indenting, and spaces to align things. It's fussy, I know.
- Underscores for naming_things instead of camelCase.
- Try to keep everything self-contained within the theme code base as much as
  possible.
- We put things in $GLOBALS['eyebeam2018'] to make things easier.
- Develop with WP_DEBUG enabled in wp-config.php, otherwise turn it off.
- Default to the simplest dumbest thing.
